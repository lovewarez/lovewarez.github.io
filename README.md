### Overveiw
Starg3n is an **easily deployable static site with a collection of intresting and high-quality games (and tools)**, which is unlike the slop that can be found on other sites of the same genre. Key features of starg3n are that it can be hosted anywhere you can host a static site (I.e Github Pages Netifly, Cloudflare Pages, Glitch, and more) and with some tweaking, can be played from a download of the site(s). starg3n is always under development, leading to a reason to come back, and making a mirror is a simple process, so anyone with a github account and a basic understanding of HTML can set it up quickly, allowing anyone to play starg3n games anywhere, anytime!

### Forking Documentation:
setting up a full, complete fork of starg3n is moderately easy, you just need to fork the repos and change the links.
> [!NOTE]
> starg3n is composed of multiple repos, 8 to be exact. forking **just** this repo is pretty much useless, as you'll lose a lot of the intresting parts of starg3n!

if you have little to no experience, to start making a starg3n mirror, or to make your own take on starg3n, read the [fork setup guide](https://github.com/starg3n/starg3n.github.io/blob/main/forksetup.md). It's quite comprehensive, and helps you quickly set up a full clone of starg3n.

### Games
starg3n's game collection includes many that aren't on the other unblocked game sites, which may draw some people away. these games are high quality peices of entertainment, unlike the basic cheap games found on other sites.
